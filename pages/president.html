        <div class ="question">1. What year are you?</div>
        <div class ="answer">Class of 2018</div>
        <div class ="question">2. What is your major??</div>
        <div class ="answer">Political Economy</div>
        <div class ="question">3. How long have you been in the club?</div>
        <div class ="answer">Since the beginning, starting with our decal & founding coordinator team! We were formed out of a decal born of the Undergraduate Women in Economics Challenge (https://scholar.harvard.edu/goldin/UWE) in Fall 2015 and have since grown to where we are today. It has been a great journey to witness and participate in!</div>
        <div class ="question">4. Why do you stand with our initiative?</div>
        <div class ="answer">I believe in our mission, first and foremost; women helping women is incredibly important and essential thing and I love being able to do my part in such a powerful movement.  It is a little-known fact that gender disparity in the upper levels of the economics field is one of the greatest in the professional world. It is an even worse disparity than that in tech!</div>
        <div class ="question">5. What do you most love about the initiative/club?</div>
        <div class ="answer">I love being part of such an inclusive and supportive group of strong women! I havenâ€™t met a group that seems to be so genuinely kind and supportive of each other until UWEB. I have been able to grow so much with my fellow officers this past year, and look forward to the opportunity to continue doing so this year as President!</div>
