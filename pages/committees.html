        <div class = "heading">Committees</div>
        <div class = "body">UWEB members have the ability to interact with several different committees. Each committee specializes in a different area whether it be within the club or network out to the community and work place. Members are able to build useful skills through interacting with different committees. The committee members are given opportunities to strengthen their resumes, build interview skills, practice how to professionally interact, and to learn about the pathways that an economics background can open up for the future. Within their committees, members are able to develop a closer community which strengthens the bond within the UWEB community and provides support for their future endeavors.</div>
